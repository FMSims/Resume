**GIS PTC PROJECT MANAGER**  
_Norfolk Southern Corporation. - Engineering - Atlanta, GA._   
_May 2017 - Current_  
---------------------     
   PTC (Positive Train Control) is a multi-billion dollar, railroad industry-wide effort to equip freight
and passenger train fleets with an onboard system that will actively and safely stop trains if it detects
unsafe conditions (speeding, incorrect routes, etc) by using advanced GPS on locomotives and detailed
geospatial files.   

   _Achieving Goals_ - I have been successful in increasing the geospatial processing efficiency by multithreading production work flows to cut weeks off production times. I have exceeded every federal
and internal corporate goal set. I have led the PTC GIS team to be ahead of schedule and to become
the ’Team to Catch’ across the PTC landscape at NS. I reduced corporate risk exposure by surpassing the federally mandated, 51% completion milestone a full 8 months ahead of the deadline.  

  _Project Management_ - I realigned the geospatial file production portion of this federally mandated
project from 3 months behind schedule to 6 months ahead of schedule. I exploit and create efficiencies
by working across divisions, engaging leadership, and streamlining project workflows. I improve data
integration between business partners to increase production speed, reduce redundancies, and increase
data integrity. I track, visualize, and report the overall project status to the Assistant Chief Engineer
and the VP level on an on going basis. I maintain exceptional relationships across the management
structure at Norfolk Southern as well as other railroads to secure upper management buy in for process
improvements.  

   _Process Improvement_ - I continually improve the following key PTC components: daily workload
of 11 GIS analysts and multiple business partners, geospatial data integration across business units,
survey accuracy and planning, all feature attribution and geolocation accuracy along 8,008 route miles
of rail corridor. I ensure the accurate and expeditious change management of the underlying geospatial
data. I maintain data standards, compatibility and synchronization with internal train dispatching
systems, engineering systems, and other internal business partners all while ensuring interoperability
of NS geospatial data with our external railroad partners, including CSX, BNSF, UP, and KCS Railroads, to ensure we are interoperable across the North American rail network.   

**GIS SOFTWARE DEVELOPER**    
_Norfolk Southern Corporation. - Engineering - Atlanta, GA._  
_May 2016 - May 2017_  
----------------------   
   _ESRI & .NET Software Development_ - I leveraged my 11 years of geospatial development experience to build custom GIS software to aid the NS Engineering Department as part of the roll out of the Positive Train Control Project. I utilized Oracle Spatial, SQL, Python scripts, C#, the .NET Framework, and ESRI’s ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET to develop custom ArcMap extensions and standalone programs. These suites were designed to ensure the highest data quality standards in the geospatial files used on the locomotives in PTC. I wrote custom scripts and software packages to QA/QC the output of other geospatial tools, automate processing of large geospatial datasets, and help GIS analysts be more efficient in their day-to-day workflows.
