#GIS PTC Project Manager . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .May 2017 - Current
PTC (Positive Train Control) is a multi-billion dollar, railroad industry-wide effort to equip freight
and passenger train fleets with an onboard system that will actively and safely stop trains if it detects
unsafe conditions (speeding, incorrect routes, etc) by using advanced GPS on locomotives and detailed
geospatial files.
Project Management - I realigned the geospatial file production portion of this federally mandated
project from 3 months behind schedule to 6 months ahead of schedule. I exploit and create efficiencies
by working across divisions, engaging leadership, and streamlining project workflows. I improve data
integration between business partners to increase production speed, reduce redundancies, and increase
data integrity. I track, visualize, and report the overall project status to the Assistant Chief Engineer
and the VP level on an on going basis. I maintain exceptional relationships across the management
structure at Norfolk Southern as well as other railroads to secure upper management buy in for process
improvements.
Process Improvement - I continually improve the following key PTC components: daily workload
of 11 GIS analysts and multiple business partners, geospatial data integration across business units,
survey accuracy and planning, all feature attribution and geolocation accuracy along 8,008 route miles
of rail corridor. I ensure the accurate and expeditious change management of the underlying geospatial
data. I maintain data standards, compatibility and synchronization with internal train dispatching
systems, engineering systems, and other internal business partners all while ensuring interoperability
of NS geospatial data with our external railroad partners, including CSX, BNSF, UP, and KCS Railroads, to ensure we are interoperable across the North American rail network.
Achieving Goals - I have been successful in increasing the geospatial processing efficiency by multithreading production work flows to cut weeks off production times. I have exceeded every federal
and internal corporate goal set. I have led the PTC GIS team to be ahead of schedule and to become
the ’Team to Catch’ across the PTC landscape at NS. I reduced corporate risk exposure by surpassing
the federally mandated, 51% completion milestone a full 8 months ahead of the deadline
